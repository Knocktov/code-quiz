Made with an inordinate amount of trial and error by Mitchell Vandermolen

Made with JS, CSS, and HTML

Started this project with an HTML layout and a simple CSS style sheet before moving on to creating the High Score (Leaderboard) page and linking the two of them together.
Afterwards solidified my color palette and font choices to give the page an simplistic yet enjoyable aesthetic.
Worked through the JS code with assistance from Matt C. in code review to make sure that all functions worked and called correctly. Tested several times with multiple users
on multiple browsers and formats to confirm functionality.
